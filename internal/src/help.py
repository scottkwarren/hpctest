HPCTest is a tool for flexible automatic configuration testing of the HPCToolkit
suite of tools. Using a collection of builtin test cases and concise
specifications given on its command line, HPCTest conducts a study by performing
test runs over a "testing matrix" of configurations, gathering and organizing
test measurements, and printing a report summarizing the results.
All test artifacts are saved in a "study directory" for later inspection.

A testing matrix is specified on the command line by a sequence of "dimension
spec" options. Each dimension spec defines a set of alternative values for one
test condition (a dimension), such as which test case to run or which Spack
configuration to build with. The testing matrix is the cross product of those
sets. Each matrix element is then a tuple of test condition values
(a "configuration") applicable to any individual test run. A dimension spec is
an expression in dimension-dependent notation specifying a set of values either
implicitly or explicitly.

For instance, '--test app/amg*' implicitly specifies a set of values for the
'test' condition (paths to tests) using shell "glob" path patterns, while
'--build %gcc@4.4.7,%gcc@4.8.5' explicitly specifies a set of values for the
'build' condition (build settings) using Spack configuration syntax. The other
dimension spec options are '--hpctoolkit' and '--profile' specifying hpctoolkit
installations and hpcrun profile settings respectively. Dimensions not specified
are given single dimension-dependent default values.

HPCTest accepts a number of subcommands on its command line. The 'run' subcommand
conducts a study using given dimension specs, while 'build' just builds the tests
and 'debug' runs each test in the debugger. The 'report' subcommand prints a
report from an existing study directory, and the 'clean' command removes unwanted
study directories, and several minor commands carry out utility operations.

Options: Informational
  -q, --quiet             Print as little as reasonable.
  -v, --verbose           Print additional informational messages.
  -D, --debug             Print debugging messages.
  -T, --traceback         Print a stack trace when an error occurs.

Options: Testing
  -t, --test TESTSPEC
            Add a dimension with the set TESTSPEC of tests as alternatives.
            Each element is a path to a test directory relative to hpctest/tests.
  -b, --build BUILDSPEC
            Add a dimension with the set BUILDSPEC of build settings as alternatives.
            Each element is a Spack spec minus package name, like %gcc@4.8.5.
  -k, --hpctoolkit HPCTKSPEC
            Add a dimension with the set HPCTKSPEC of paths as alternatives.
            Each element is a path to an HPCToolkit install/bin directory.
  -p, --profile PROFILESPEC
            Add a dimension with the set PROFILESPEC of profile options as
            alternatives. Each element is a colon-separated triple of options
            for hpcrun, hpcstruct, and hpcprof.
  -s, --spack SPACKPATH
            If given, use the Spack installed at SPACKPATH. Otherwise use
            the default Spack embedded in hpctest.
  -o, --study STUDYPATH
            If given, create the study directory at the specified path. Otherwise
            the default is to create it inside the hpctest/work directory.
  -V, --version
            Print this hpctest's version number.

Options: Reporting
  -w, --which WHICHSPEC
            Print only the specified subset of test results.
  -S, --sort SORTSPEC
            Print the test results sorted by each specified field in turn.

Options: Cleaning
  all
            Remove everything below.
  -s, --studies
            Remove all study directories from hpctest/work.
  -B, --built
            Remove all built test executables, but not their dependencies.
  -d, --dependencies
            Remove all built dependencies of all tests.
  -f, --force
            Don't ask for confirmation, just remove the specified objects.

Arguments:        All lists are space-separated without commas.
  BUILDSPEC       list of Spack specs minus package names, eg '%gcc@4.4.7'
  HPCTKSPEC       list of paths with wildcards pointing to hpctoolkit/install dirs
  PROFILESPEC     list of colon-separated arguments to hpcrun:hpcstruct:hpcprof
  SORTSPEC        list of dimensions ('tests'/'build'/'profile'/'hpctoolkit')
  SPACKCMD        subcommand for Spack, eg 'install openmpi'
  STUDYPATH       path with wildcards, absolute or relative to hpctest/work
  TESTSPEC        list of paths with wildcards relative to hpctest/tests
  WHICHSPEC       one of 'all', 'pass', or 'fail'

Examples:

  hpctest run all
  hpctest run app/amgmk app/lulesh app/laghos
  hpctest run app/amg* unit-test/*

  hpctest run all --build %gcc@4.4.7
  hpctest run all --build %clang^mpich@3.1.4
  hpctest run all --build "%gcc@4.4.7 %gcc@4.8.5 clang"

  hpctest run unit-test/* app/amg*  \\
          --build "%gcc@4.4.7 %gcc@4.8.5"  \\
          --profile "REALTIME@10000 REALTIME@1000 REALTIME@100"  \\
          --study ~/mystudies/june/trial_12
  
  hpctest report --study work/study-2020-06-01--18-29-59 --which fail --sort build
  
  hpctest clean all -f
