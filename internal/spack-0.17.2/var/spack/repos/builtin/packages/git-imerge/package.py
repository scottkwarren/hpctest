class GitImerge(MakefilePackage):
    """git-imerge: Incremental merge & rebase for git

       Perform a merge between two branches incrementally. If
       conflicts are encountered, figure out exactly which pairs of
       commits conflict, and present the user with one pairwise
       conflict at a time for resolution.

       git-imerge has two primary design goals:

       * Reduce the pain of resolving merge conflicts to its
         unavoidable minimum, by finding and presenting the smallest
         possible conflicts: those between the changes introduced by
         one commit from each branch.

       * Allow a merge to be saved, tested, interrupted, published,
         and collaborated on while it is in progress."""
