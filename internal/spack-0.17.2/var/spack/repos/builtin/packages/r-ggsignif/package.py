    """Enrich your 'ggplots' with group-wise comparisons. This package provides
    an easy way to indicate if two groups are significantly different. Commonly
    this is shown by a bracket on top connecting the groups of interest which
    itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS, *, **, ***). The
    package provides a single layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for
    comparison and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and
    adds the annotation to the plot."""
