class PyCythonBbox(PythonPackage):
    """cython_bbox is widely used in object detection tasks. To my
    best knowledge, it was first implemented in Faster-RCNN. Since
    then, almost all object detection projects use the source code
    directly. In order to use it in standalone code snippets or small projects,
    I make it a pypi module. The cython_bbox.pyx is totally borrowed
    from Faster-RCNN. Thanks RBG!"""
