    """svn2git is a tiny utility for migrating projects from Subversion to Git
    while keeping the trunk, branches and tags where they should be. It uses
    git-svn to clone an svn repository and does some clean-up to make sure
    branches and tags are imported in a meaningful way, and that the code
    checked into master ends up being what's currently in your svn trunk rather
    than whichever svn branch your last commit was in."""
