    """Tools for Spatial Data

    For curve, surface and function fitting with an emphasis; on splines,
    spatial data, geostatistics,  and spatial statistics. The major methods;
    include cubic, and thin plate splines, Kriging, and compactly supported;
    covariance functions for large data sets. The splines and Kriging methods
    are; supported by functions that can determine the smoothing parameter;
    (nugget and sill variance) and other covariance function parameters by
    cross; validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging;
    there is an easy to use function that also estimates the correlation; scale
    (range parameter).  A major feature is that any covariance function;
    implemented in R and following a simple format can be used for; spatial
    prediction. There are also many useful functions for plotting; and working
    with spatial data as images. This package also contains; an implementation
    of sparse matrix methods for large spatial data; sets and currently
    requires the sparse matrix (spam) package. Use; help(fields) to get started
    and for an overview.  The fields source; code is deliberately commented and
    provides useful explanations of; numerical details as a companion to the
    manual pages. The commented; source code can be viewed by expanding the
    source code version; and looking in the R subdirectory. The reference for
    fields can be generated; by the citation function in R and has DOI
    <doi:10.5065/D6W957CT>. Development; of this package was supported in part
    by the National Science Foundation  Grant; 1417857,  the National Center
    for Atmospheric Research, and Colorado School of Mines.; See the Fields
    URL; for a vignette on using this package and some background on spatial
    statistics."""
