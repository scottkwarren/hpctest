    """S3 Methods Simplified

    Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and
    S3 methods. Major effort has been made in making definition of
    methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintenance for
    package developers. For example, generic functions are created
    automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically
    solved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is a good start
    for those who in the future may want to migrate to S4. This is
    a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that generates
    standard S3 methods."""
