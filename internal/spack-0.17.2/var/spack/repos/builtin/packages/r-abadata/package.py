    """Averaged gene expression in human brain regions from Allen Brain Atlas

       Provides the data for the gene expression enrichment analysis conducted
       in the package 'ABAEnrichment'. The package includes three datasets
       which are derived from the Allen Brain Atlas: (1) Gene expression data
       from Human Brain (adults) averaged across donors, (2) Gene expression
       data from the Developing Human Brain pooled into five age categories and
       averaged across donors and (3) a developmental effect score based on the
       Developing Human Brain expression data. All datasets are restricted to
       protein coding genes."""
