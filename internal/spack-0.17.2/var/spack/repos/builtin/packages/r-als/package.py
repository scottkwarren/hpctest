    """Alternating least squares is often used to resolve components
    contributing to data with a bilinear structure; the basic
    technique may be extended to alternating constrained least squares.
    Commonly applied constraints include unimodality, non-negativity,
    and normalization of components. Several data matrices may be
    decomposed simultaneously by assuming that one of the two matrices
    in the bilinear decomposition is shared between datasets."""
