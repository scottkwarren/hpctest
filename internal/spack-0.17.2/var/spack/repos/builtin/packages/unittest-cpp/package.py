    """UnitTest++ is a lightweight unit testing framework for C++. It was
    designed to do test-driven development on a wide variety of platforms.
    Simplicity, portability, speed, and small footprint are all very
    important aspects of UnitTest++. UnitTest++ is mostly standard C++ and
    makes minimal use of advanced library and language features, which
    means it should be easily portable to just about any platform."""
