    """R graphics device using cairo graphics library for creating high-quality
    bitmap (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), vector (PDF, SVG, PostScript) and display (X11
    and Win32) output

    R graphics device using cairographics library that can be used to create
    high-quality vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and bitmap output
    (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in displays (X11 and Win32).
    Since it uses the same back-end for all output, copying across formats is
    WYSIWYG. Files are created without the dependence on X11 or other external
    programs. This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and
    resulting images can contain transparent and semi-transparent regions. It
    is ideal for use in server environments (file output) and as a replacement
    for other devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities such as alpha
    support or anti-aliasing. Backends are modular such that any subset of
    backends is supported."""
