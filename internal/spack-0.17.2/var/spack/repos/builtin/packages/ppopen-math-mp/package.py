    """
    ppOpen-Math/MP ia a coupling library that enables weak coupling on various
    simulation models, such as an atmospheric model and an ocean model,
    a seismic model and a structure model. For getting very wide applicability,
    ppOpen-Math/MP is designed so as that it is independent from grid
    structure.  Instead of grid structure, PpohMATHMP requires a data set
    called 'mapping table'. Mapping table is composed of a correspondence
    table of grid indexes between a send model and a receive model and
    interpolation coefficients. A subroutine for making a mapping table
    file is provided by ppOpen-Math/MP API.

    Current version of ppOpen-Math/MP is ver.1.0 which targets scalar
    data exchange.  An exchange code of vector data which requires rotation
    calculation is under development and will be released the next version.
