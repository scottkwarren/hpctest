    """Profiling API for adding tool instrumentation support to any project.

    This was motivated by the need to quickly add instrumentation to the
    [ADIOS2](https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS2) library without adding a build
    dependency, or tying to a specific measurement tool.

    The initial prototype implementation was tied to TAU, but evolved to this more
    generic version, which was extracted as a separate repository for testing and
    demonstration purposes.
