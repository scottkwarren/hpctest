    """Ragel State Machine Compiler
    Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from regular
    languages. Ragel targets C, C++ and ASM. Ragel state machines can
    not only recognize byte sequences as regular expression machines
    do, but can also execute code at arbitrary points in the
    recognition of a regular language. Code embedding is done using
    inline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax.
