    """flexmock is a testing library for Python that makes it easy to create
    mocks,stubs and fakes.

    Its API is inspired by a Ruby library of the same name. However, it is not
    a goal of Python flexmock to be a clone of the Ruby version. Instead, the
    focus is on providing full support for testing Python programs and making
    the creation of fake objects as unobtrusive as possible."""
