class RRcppdate(RPackage):
    """'date' C++ Header Library for Date and Time Functionality

    'date' is a C++ header library offering extensive date and time
    functionality for the C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards written by Howard
    Hinnant and released under the MIT license. A slightly modified version has
    been accepted (along with 'tz.h') as part of C++20. This package regroups
    all header files from the upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that
    other R packages can use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the
    types have explicit 'Rcpp' wrapper though these may be added as needed."""
