    """Library to implement a well-behaved Unix daemon process.

       This library implements the well-behaved daemon specification of
       PEP Standard daemon process.

       A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but the
       required steps are much the same for every daemon program. A
       DaemonContext instance holds the behaviour and configured process
       environment for the program; use the instance as a context manager
       to enter a daemon state.
