class RRuv(RPackage):
    """Detect and Remove Unwanted Variation using Negative Controls:

    Implements the 'RUV' (Remove Unwanted Variation) algorithms. These
    algorithms attempt to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in
    high-dimensional data. The algorithms were originally developed for use
    with genomic data, especially microarray data, but may be useful with other
    types of high-dimensional data as well. These algorithms were proposed in
    Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>, Gagnon-Bartsch,
    Jacob and Speed (2013), and Molania, et. al. (2019)
    <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>. The algorithms require the user to specify a set
    of negative control variables, as described in the references. The
    algorithms included in this package are 'RUV-2', 'RUV-4', 'RUV-inv',
    'RUV-rinv', 'RUV-I', and RUV-III', along with various supporting
    algorithms."""
