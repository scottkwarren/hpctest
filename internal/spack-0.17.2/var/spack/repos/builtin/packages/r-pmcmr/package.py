    """The Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks or van
       der Waerden's normal score test can be employed, if the data do not
       meet the assumptions for one-way ANOVA. Provided that significant
       differences were detected by the omnibus test, one may be interested
       in applying post-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons (such as
       Nemenyi's test, Dunn's test, Conover's test, van der Waerden's test).
       Similarly, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures that is also referred
       to as ANOVA with unreplicated block design can also be conducted via
       the Friedman-Test or the Quade-test. The consequent post-hoc pairwise
       multiple comparison tests according to Nemenyi, Conover and Quade are
       also provided in this package. Finally Durbin's test for a two-way
       balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is also given in this
       package."""
