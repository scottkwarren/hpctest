class PerlIoAll(PerlPackage):
    """IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single nifty
    object oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO idioms.
    It exports a single function called io, which returns a new IO::All object.
    And that object can do it all!

    The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, Tie::File,
    File::Spec, File::Path, File::MimeInfo and File::ReadBackwards; as well as
    all the DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in
    these classes and in IO::Handle (which they inherit from). IO::All adds
    dozens of other helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and
    manipulation functions.

    IO::All is pluggable, and modules like IO::All::LWP and IO::All::Mailto add
    even more functionality. Optionally, every IO::All object can be tied to
    itself. This means that you can use most perl IO builtins on it: readline,
    <>, getc, print, printf, syswrite, sysread, close."""
