# v0.17.0 (2021-11-05)

`v0.17.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **New concretizer is now default**
   The new concretizer introduced as an experimental feature in `v0.16.0`
   is now the default (#25502). The new concretizer is based on the
   [clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) logic programming system,
   and it enables us to do much higher quality and faster dependency solving
   The old concretizer is still available via the `concretizer: original`
   setting, but it is deprecated and will be removed in `v0.18.0`.

2. **Binary Bootstrapping**
   To make it easier to use the new concretizer and binary packages,
   Spack now bootstraps `clingo` and `GnuPG` from public binaries. If it
   is not able to bootstrap them from binaries, it installs them from
   source code. With these changes, you should still be able to clone Spack
   and start using it almost immediately. (#21446, #22354, #22489, #22606,
   #22720, #22720, #23677, #23946, #24003, #25138, #25607, #25964, #26029,
   #26399, #26599).

3. **Reuse existing packages (experimental)**
   The most wanted feature from our
   [2020 user survey](https://spack.io/spack-user-survey-2020/) and
   the most wanted Spack feature of all time (#25310). `spack install`,
   `spack spec`, and `spack concretize` now have a `--reuse` option, which
   causes Spack to minimize the number of rebuilds it does. The `--reuse`
   option will try to find existing installations and binary packages locally
   and in registered mirrors, and will prefer to use them over building new
   versions. This will allow users to build from source *far* less than in
   prior versions of Spack. This feature will continue to be improved, with
   configuration options and better CLI expected in `v0.17.1`. It will become
   the *default* concretization mode in `v0.18.0`.

4. **Better error messages**
   We have improved the error messages generated by the new concretizer by
   using *unsatisfiable cores*. Spack will now print a summary of the types
   of constraints that were violated to make a spec unsatisfiable (#26719).

5. **Conditional variants**
   Variants can now have a `when="<spec>"` clause, allowing them to be
   conditional based on the version or other attributes of a package (#24858).

6. **Git commit versions**
   In an environment and on the command-line, you can now provide a full,
   40-character git commit as a version for any package with a top-level
   `git` URL.  e.g., `spack install hdf5@45bb27f58240a8da7ebb4efc821a1a964d7712a8`.
   Spack will compare the commit to tags in the git repository to understand
   what versions it is ahead of or behind.

7. **Override local config and cache directories**
   You can now set `SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG` to disable the `~/.spack` and
   `/etc/spack` configuration scopes. `SPACK_USER_CACHE_PATH` allows you to
   move caches out of `~/.spack`, as well (#27022, #26735). This addresses
   common problems where users could not isolate CI environments from local
   configuration.

8. **Improvements to Spack Containerize**
   For added reproducibility, you can now pin the Spack version used by
   `spack containerize` (#21910). The container build will only build
   with the Spack version pinned at build recipe creation instead of the
   latest Spack version.

9. **New commands for dealing with tags**
   The `spack tags` command allows you to list tags on packages (#26136), and you
   can list tests and filter tags with `spack test list` (#26842).

# v0.16.0 (2020-11-18)

`v0.16.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **New concretizer (experimental)** Our new backtracking concretizer is
   now in Spack as an experimental feature. You will need to install
   `clingo@master+python` and set `concretizer: clingo` in `config.yaml`
   to use it. The original concretizer is not exhaustive and is not
   guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. We encourage you to use
   the new concretizer and to report any bugs you find with it. We
   anticipate making the new concretizer the default and including all
   required dependencies for it in Spack `v0.17`. For more details, see
   #19501.

2. **spack test (experimental)** Users can add `test()` methods to their
   packages to run smoke tests on installations with the new `spack test`
   command (the old `spack test` is now `spack unit-test`). `spack test`
   is environment-aware, so you can `spack install` an environment and
   `spack test run` smoke tests on all of its packages. Historical test
   logs can be perused with `spack test results`. Generic smoke tests for
   MPI implementations, C, C++, and Fortran compilers as well as specific
   smoke tests for 18 packages. This is marked experimental because the
   test API (`self.run_test()`) is likely to be change, but we encourage
   users to upstream tests, and we will maintain and refactor any that
   are added to mainline packages (#15702).

3. **spack develop** New `spack develop` command allows you to develop
   several packages at once within a Spack environment. Running
   `spack develop foo@v1` and `spack develop bar@v2` will check
    out specific versions of `foo` and `bar` into subdirectories, which you
    can then build incrementally with `spack install ` (#15256).

4. **More parallelism** Spack previously installed the dependencies of a
   _single_ spec in parallel. Entire environments can now be installed in
   parallel, greatly accelerating builds of large environments. get
   parallelism from individual specs. Spack now parallelizes entire
   environment builds (#18131).

5. **Customizable base images for spack containerize**
    `spack containerize` previously only output a `Dockerfile` based
    on `ubuntu`. You may now specify any base image of your choosing (#15028).

6. **more external finding** `spack external find` was added in `v0.15`,
   but only `cmake` had support. `spack external find` can now find
   `bison`, `cuda`, `findutils`, `flex`, `git`, `lustre` `m4`, `mpich`,
   `mvapich2`, `ncurses`, `openmpi`, `perl`, `spectrum-mpi`, `tar`, and
   `texinfo` on your system and add them automatically to
   `packages.yaml`.

7. **Support aocc, nvhpc, and oneapi compilers** We are aggressively
   pursuing support for the newest vendor compilers, especially those for
   the U.S. exascale and pre-exascale systems. Compiler classes and
   auto-detection for `aocc`, `nvhpc`, `oneapi` are now in Spack (#19345,
   #19294, #19330).

## Additional new features of note

* New `spack mark` command can be used to designate packages as explicitly
  installed, so that `spack gc` will not garbage-collect them (#16662).
* `install_tree` can be customized with Spack's projection format (#18341)
* `sbang` now lives in the `install_tree` so that all users can access it (#11598)
* `csh` and `tcsh` users no longer need to set `SPACK_ROOT` before
  sourcing `setup-env.csh` (#18225)
* Spec syntax now supports `variant=*` syntax for finding any package
  that has a particular variant (#19381).
* Spack respects `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` variable for custom GPG directories (#17139)
* Spack now recognizes Graviton chips

## Major refactors

* Use spawn instead of fork on Python >= 3.8 on macOS (#18205)
* Use indexes for public build caches (#19101, #19117, #19132, #19141,  #19209)
* `sbang` is an external package now (https://github.com/spack/sbang, #19582)
* `archspec` is an external package now (https://github.com/archspec/archspec, #19600)

## Deprecations and Removals

* `spack bootstrap` was deprecated in v0.14.0, and has now been removed.
* `spack setup` is deprecated as of v0.16.0.
* What was `spack test` is now called `spack unit-test`. `spack test` is
  now the smoke testing feature in (2) above.

## Bugfixes

Some of the most notable bugfixes in this release include:

* Better warning messages for deprecated syntax in `packages.yaml` (#18013)
* `buildcache list --allarch` now works properly (#17827)
* Many fixes and tests for buildcaches and binary relcoation (#15687,
  *#17455, #17418, #17455, #15687, #18110)

## Package Improvements

Spack now has 5050 total packages, 720 of which were added since `v0.15`.

* ROCm packages (`hip`, `aomp`, more) added by AMD (#19957, #19832, others)
* Many improvements for ARM support
* `llvm-flang`, `flang`, and `f18` removed, as `llvm` has real `flang`
  support since Flang was merged to LLVM mainline
* Emerging support for `spack external find` and `spack test` in packages.

## Infrastructure

* Major infrastructure improvements to pipelines on `gitlab.spack.io`
* Support for testing PRs from forks (#19248) is being enabled for all
  forks to enable rolling, up-to-date binary builds on `develop`


# v0.15.4 (2020-08-12)

This release contains one feature addition:

* Users can set `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` to override Spack's GPG path (#17139)

Several bugfixes for CUDA, binary packaging, and `spack -V`:

* CUDA package's `.libs` method searches for `libcudart` instead of `libcuda` (#18000)
* Don't set `CUDAHOSTCXX` in environments that contain CUDA (#17826)
* `buildcache create`: `NoOverwriteException` is a warning, not an error (#17832)
* Fix `spack buildcache list --allarch` (#17884)
* `spack -V` works with `releases/latest` tag and shallow clones (#17884)

And fixes for GitHub Actions and tests to ensure that CI passes on the
release branch (#15687, #17279, #17328, #17377, #17732).

# v0.15.3 (2020-07-28)

This release contains the following bugfixes:

* Fix handling of relative view paths (#17721)
* Fixes for binary relocation (#17418, #17455)
* Fix redundant printing of error messages in build environment (#17709)

It also adds a support script for Spack tutorials:

* Add a tutorial setup script to share/spack (#17705, #17722)

# v0.15.2 (2020-07-23)

This minor release includes two new features:

* Spack install verbosity is decreased, and more debug levels are added (#17546)
* The $spack/share/spack/keys directory contains public keys that may be optionally trusted for public binary mirrors (#17684)

This release also includes several important fixes:

* MPICC and related variables are now cleand in the build environment (#17450)
* LLVM flang only builds CUDA offload components when +cuda (#17466)
* CI pipelines no longer upload user environments that can contain secrets to the internet (#17545)
* CI pipelines add bootstrapped compilers to the compiler config (#17536)

  explicitly activated (#17454)

This release also adds a mirror for all sources that are
fetched in Spack (#17077). It is expected to be useful when the
official website for a Spack package is unavailable.

# v0.15.0 (2020-06-28)

`v0.15.0` is a major feature release.

## Major Features in this release

1. **Cray support** Spack will now work properly on Cray "Cluster"
systems (non XC systems) and after a `module purge` command on Cray
systems. See #12989

2. **Virtual package configuration** Virtual packages are allowed in
packages.yaml configuration. This allows users to specify a virtual
package as non-buildable without needing to specify for each
implementation. See #14934

3. **New config subcommands** This release adds `spack config add` and
`spack config remove` commands to add to and remove from yaml
configuration files from the CLI. See #13920

4. **Environment activation** Anonymous environments are **no longer**
automatically activated in the current working directory. To activate
an environment from a `spack.yaml` file in the current directory, use
the `spack env activate .` command. This removes a concern that users
were too easily polluting their anonymous environments with accidental
installations. See #17258

5. **Apple clang compiler** The clang compiler and the apple-clang
compiler are now separate compilers in Spack. This allows Spack to
improve support for the apple-clang compiler. See #17110

6. **Finding external packages** Spack packages can now support an API
for finding external installations. This allows the `spack external
find` command to automatically add installations of those packages to
the user's configuration. See #15158


## Additional new features of note

* support for using Spack with the fish shell (#9279)
* `spack load --first` option to load first match (instead of prompting user) (#15622)

* remove some unused code (#15431)

# v0.14.0 (2020-02-23)

`v0.14.0` is a major feature release, with 3 highlighted features:

1. **Distributed builds.** Multiple Spack instances will now coordinate
   properly with each other through locks. This works on a single node
   (where you've called `spack` several times) or across multiple nodes
   with a shared filesystem. For example, with SLURM, you could build
   `trilinos` and its dependencies on 2 24-core nodes, with 3 Spack
   instances per node and 8 build jobs per instance, with `srun -N 2 -n 6
   spack install -j 8 trilinos`. This requires a filesystem with locking
   enabled, but not MPI or any other library for parallelism.

2.  **Build pipelines.** You can also build in parallel through Gitlab
   CI. Simply create a Spack environment and push it to Gitlab to build
   on Gitlab runners. Pipeline support is now integrated into a single
   `spack ci` command, so setting it up is easier than ever.  See the
   [Pipelines section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.14.0/pipelines.html)
   in the docs.

3. **Container builds.** The new `spack containerize` command allows you
   to create a Docker or Singularity recipe from any Spack environment.
   There are options to customize the build if you need them. See the
   [Container Images section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/containers.html)
   in the docs.

In addition, there are several other new commands, many bugfixes and
improvements, and `spack load` no longer requires modules, so you can use
it the same way on your laptop or on your supercomputer.

Spack grew by over 300 packages since our last release in November 2019,
and the project grew to over 500 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for
making yet another great release possible. Detailed notes below.

# v0.13.0 (2019-10-25)

`v0.13.0` is our biggest Spack release yet, with *many* new major features.
From facility deployment to improved environments, microarchitecture
support, and auto-generated build farms, this release has features for all of
our users.

Spack grew by over 700 packages in the past year, and the project now has
over 450 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for making this release possible.

## Major new core features
- Chaining: use dependencies from external "upstream" Spack instances
- Environments now behave more like virtualenv/conda
  - Each env has a *view*: a directory with all packages symlinked in
  - Activating an environment sets `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH`,
    `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, etc. to point to this view.
- Spack detects and builds specifically for your microarchitecture
  - named, understandable targets like `skylake`, `broadwell`, `power9`, `zen2`
  - Spack knows which compilers can build for which architectures
  - Packages can easily query support for features like `avx512` and `sse3`
  - You can pick a target with, e.g. `spack install foo target=icelake`
- Spack stacks: combinatorial environments for facility deployment
  - Environments can now build cartesian products of specs (with `matrix:`)
  - Conditional syntax support to exclude certain builds from the stack
- Projections: ability to build easily navigable symlink trees environments
- Support no-source packages (BundlePackage) to aggregate related packages
- Extensions: users can write custom commands that live outside of Spack repo
- Support ARM and Fujitsu compilers

## CI/build farm support
- `spack release-jobs` can detect `package.py` changes and generate
    `.gitlab-ci.yml` to create binaries for an environment or stack
	in parallel (initial support -- will change in future release).
- Results of build pipelines can be uploaded to a CDash server.
- Spack can now upload/fetch from package mirrors in Amazon S3

## New commands/options
- `spack mirror create --all` downloads *all* package sources/resources/patches
- `spack dev-build` runs phases of the install pipeline on the working directory
- `spack deprecate` permanently symlinks an old, unwanted package to a new one
- `spack verify` chcecks that packages' files match what was originally installed
- `spack find --json` prints `JSON` that is easy to parse with, e.g. `jq`
- `spack find --format FORMAT` allows you to flexibly print package metadata
- `spack spec --json` prints JSON version of `spec.yaml`

## Selected improvements
- Auto-build requested compilers if they do not exist
- Spack automatically adds `RPATHs` needed to make executables find compiler
    runtime libraries (e.g., path to newer `libstdc++` in `icpc` or `g++`)
- setup-env.sh is now compatible with Bash, Dash, and Zsh
- Spack now caps build jobs at min(16, ncores) by default
- `spack compiler find` now also throttles number of spawned processes
- Spack now writes stage directories directly to `$TMPDIR` instead of
    symlinking stages within `$spack/var/spack/cache`.
- Improved and more powerful `spec` format strings
- You can pass a `spec.yaml` file anywhere in the CLI you can type a spec.
- Many improvements to binary caching
- Gradually supporting new features from Environment Modules v4
- `spack edit` respects `VISUAL` environment variable
- Simplified package syntax for specifying build/run environment modifications
- Numerous improvements to support for environments across Spack commands
- Concretization improvements

## Documentation
- Multi-lingual documentation (Started a Japanese translation)
- Tutorial now has its own site at spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io
  - This enables us to keep multiple versions of the tutorial around

## Deprecations
- Spack no longer supports dotkit (LLNL's homegrown, now deprecated module tool)
- `spack build`, `spack configure`, `spack diy` deprecated in favor of
    `spack dev-build` and `spack install`

## Important package changes
- 3,563 total packages (718 added since 0.12.1)
- Spack now defaults to Python 3 (previously preferred 2.7 by default)
- Much improved ARM support thanks to Fugaku (RIKEN) and SNL teams
- Support new special versions: master, trunk, and head (in addition to develop)
- Better finding logic for libraries and headers


# v0.12.1 (2018-11-13)

This is a minor bugfix release, with a minor fix in the tutorial and a `flake8` fix.

Bugfixes
* Add `r` back to regex strings in binary distribution
* Fix gcc install version in the tutorial


# v0.12.0 (2018-11-13)
