  description: >
    MiniFE is an proxy application for unstructured implicit finite element 
    codes. It is similar to HPCCG and pHPCCG but provides a much more complete 
    vertical covering of the steps in this class of applications. MiniFE also 
    provides support for computation on multicore nodes, including pthreads 
    and Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) for homogeneous multicore and 
    CUDA for GPUs. Like HPCCG and pHPCCG, MiniFE is intended to be the best 
    approximation to an unstructured implicit finite element or finite volume 
    application, but in 8000 lines or fewer.
