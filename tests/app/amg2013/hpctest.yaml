  description: >
    AMG2013 is a parallel algebraic multigrid solver for linear systems arising from
    problems on unstructured grids.  The driver provided with AMG2013 builds linear 
    systems for various 3-dimensional problems.
    AMG2013 is written in ISO-C.  It is an SPMD code which uses MPI and OpenMP 
    threading within MPI tasks. Parallelism is achieved by data decomposition. The 
    driver provided with AMG2013 achieves this decomposition by simply subdividing 
    the grid into logical P x Q x R (in 3D) chunks of equal size.
